# PasswordStrengthChecker

Password strength is determined by factors such as
- Length of the password
- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Numeric Characters
- Special Characters - @#$%^&*(){}[]!/*-
- Randomness - Doesn't include firstname or lastname or date of birth of the user

In this project, I decided not to go with randomness, to keep it simple.
